## Manual Mode

In manual mode, the user has direct control over the intensity of each LED via switches. This mode allows for individual adjustment of each LED, offering maximum flexibility in creating a personalized lighting environment.

## Test Mode

The test mode is designed to verify and demonstrate the ability of each LED to vary its light intensity. In this mode, each LED changes its brightness in a preset cycle, from minimum to maximum, following a sawtooth wave pattern, with different durations for each LED.

## Automatic Mode

In automatic mode, the system automatically controls the intensity of all LEDs, creating a smooth and continuous variation of light, similar to a triangular wave pattern. This mode is ideal for demonstrations or for creating dynamic lighting effects without user intervention.

## Switching Between Modes

Switching between operating modes is managed by a central control logic. It monitors the mode selection signals and switches the output to the LEDs accordingly. The user can select the desired mode by simply changing the position of the mode switches, and the system responds instantly, switching to the appropriate configuration.
