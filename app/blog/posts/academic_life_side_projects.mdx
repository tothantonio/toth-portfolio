# Prioritize and plan

* Set clear goals:

Start by defining your goals for both your academic life and side projects. 
Understand what you want to achieve each semester or quarter and break it down into manageable tasks.

* Use a planner:

Whether it's a physical planner or a digital tool like Google Calendar, allocate specific time slots for your classes, study sessions, project work, and any internships. 
Stick to this schedule as much as possible.


# Time management techniques

* Pomodoro Technique: 

This method involves working for 25 minutes and then taking a 5-minute break. After four sessions, take a longer break (15-30 minutes). 
It’s effective for staying focused and preventing burnout.🕗

# Leverage Technology

* Note-taking apps:

Use apps like Notion or Evernote to keep your lecture notes, project ideas, and to-do lists organized in one place.📝
This ensures you have easy access to all your materials when you need them.

# Learn to say No

* Avoid Overcommitting:

It’s tempting to take on multiple projects or say yes to every opportunity, but it’s essential to know your limits.🙅🏽‍♂️
Prioritize tasks that align with your goals and be realistic about what you can handle.

# Take care of yourself

* Prioritize Sleep and Nutrition:

Adequate sleep and a balanced diet are crucial for maintaining energy levels and cognitive function. 
Avoid the trap of pulling all-nighters, as they can negatively impact your productivity.

* Exercise Regularly:

Physical activity boosts brain function and helps reduce stress.🏃🏼 
Even short walks or quick workouts can make a significant difference in your overall well-being.

# Be Adaptable

* Review and Adjust:

Regularly assess your progress in both academics and side projects. If something isn’t working, don’t be afraid to adjust your plan. Flexibility is key to maintaining balance.

* Prepare for the Unexpected: 

Life is unpredictable.😮 
Build in buffer time for unexpected tasks or emergencies so that you can handle them without derailing your entire schedule.

# Reflect and Learn

* End-of-Week Reflection: 

Spend a few minutes at the end of each week reviewing what you’ve accomplished and where you might need to adjust. 
This reflection helps you stay on track and continuously improve your time management.

# Celebrate small wins

* Acknowledge Your Progress:

This could be as simple as taking a break to enjoy a hobby or treat yourself to something you like.

By implementing these strategies, you can manage your time effectively and make meaningful progress in both your studies and personal projects without burning out.
