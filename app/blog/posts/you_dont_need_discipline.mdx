*You don't need discipline, you just need to care enough.*

Most of the time we tend to dread doing things and procrastinate, even tough we know we have to do it. Actually, do we really need to do it?

When we look at people who keep doing what they do, we tend to think "oh, they must be so disciplined". What I see is that they just cared more than others did. Discipline is a fruit of caring enough.


**?Why?**

The way you actually start caring is to get into the roots of why you even started this thing. Why did you choose CS? Why did you choose to start building that thing? It's very easy to forget why we chose to do some things. But it's not hard to remember either.

Has that reason changed? Is it still there? Those are very good indicators if you should continue doing what you do. Of course, I'm not saying you should give up if something changes. Sometimes we need to keep going just to find our reasons sitting somewhere else.

I just finished the first week of the second year of uni, and I decided to write some things that came to my mind. I advise you to think deep, and **find out your why**. It might just keep you going. It might make you realize that you have gone off the path. It might give you a new perspective to what you do.

*Pain is just a stepping stone. You get through it, and you come out stronger on the other side.*
