*After finishing high school, I only had some knowledge in C, a little bit of HTML and CSS, and also a lot of mathðŸ™‚. After the first year of uni thing have changed drastically.*

First of all, I learned that I have to study alone, by myself, to get good grades. I also encourage all of you to adapt to this as soon as possible. I know it's hard and it's going to be a long journey, but it will all be worth in the end.

[Google](https://www.google.com/), [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/) needs to be your best friends. You will be overwhelmed by all the websites and resources, but you need to know wich of them are good.

**Data Structures and Algorithms.** This is the main thing that you need to master. Uh, maybe not master but to be very good at it. And also avoid to start with Python, JavaScript, etc. because you need to know what is under the "hood" of all newer languages.
C and C++ are the main base and each developer, software engineer needs to master them. I recommand this book, that I've studied in my first year on university:

[Introduction to Algorithms-Thomas Cormen](https://dl.ebooksworld.ir/books/Introduction.to.Algorithms.4th.Leiserson.Stein.Rivest.Cormen.MIT.Press.9780262046305.EBooksWorld.ir.pdf)

Also some very good websites to learn from:

-[freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
-[GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/)
-[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)

# How to learn new technologies?

Trying to memorize Algorithms that we've talked about is **BIG** mistake. Actually learning a technology means doing, building something. So, try to build a lot of personal projects, **learn by doing**ðŸš¨.

# Frameworks

A simple website does not need any framework, it could be made with HTML/CSS/JS. The frameworks are good on big apps, large codebases - Instagram, Facebook.
There are a lot of frameworks, and the opinons are divided, but photo can tell us what is the best framework.

ReactJS, Angular and Vue are the main leaders, but, alongside other developers, I choose ReactJS because it's easy to understand and can create a lot of beautiful things.
Also, a great place to learn react is Youtube, where you will find a lot of tutorials to learn from.

# In conclusion

Thank you for reading my first blog, I know my style is not perfect but I will try to make it better. For any suggestions or modifications react me on [Twitter](https://x.com/itunaic).
*The main thing to take away: Don't stop working and learning! Build more projects because that is the best way to learn new things.*

So, given that, do whatever you want to do and enjoy, and you will end up in the perfect place.âœ¨
